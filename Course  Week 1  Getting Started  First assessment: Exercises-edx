#2. Create a numeric vector containing the numbers 2.23, 3.45, 1.87, 2.11, 7.33, 18.34, 19.23.
x <- c(2.23, 3.45, 1.87, 2.11, 7.33, 18.34, 19.23)
0
What is the average of these numbers?
mean(x)
7.794286

#3. Use a for loop to determine the value of  ∑25i=1i2.
library(loop)
soma
install.packages("CARS")
sum <- 0
for(i in 1:25)
  sum <- sum + i^2
sum

#4. The cars dataset is available in base R. You can type cars to see it. Use the class() 
function to determine what type of object is cars. What is the name of the second column of cars?
install.packages(cars)
library(CARS)
class(cars)
data.frame 

#5. How many rows does the cars object have?
nrow(cars)
50

#6. What is the name of the second column of cars?
Distância do conjuntos de dados 
mean(cars[,2])
dist

#7. The simplest way to extract the columns of a matrix or data.frame is using [. 
For example you can access the second column with cars[,2].
What is the average distance traveled in this dataset?
mean(cars[,2])  
42.98

#8. Familiarize yourself with the which() function. Which row of cars has a a distance of 85?
which(cars[,2]==85)
50
